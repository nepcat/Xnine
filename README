Xnine is a library under MIT Licence designed to be a demo of the Gallium Nine API, without requiring wine.

To run with any DXVK-compatible (Vulkan-supporting) Source engine game, use a steam command line of `LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/nine_sdl.so %command% -vulkan`.

For Portal 2 (as of November 2021), add `NINE_VHACKS=1`.

To use a custom nine build, set `D3D_MODULE_PATH=/path/to/d3dadapter9.so`.
